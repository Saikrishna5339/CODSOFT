**CODSOFT Internship Projects**
This repository contains the tasks completed during my CodSoft Internship (July 2025 - August 2025).
Each task is implemented with clean code, proper documentation, and follows best practices in programming and UI/UX design.

**Overview**
-During this internship, I worked on multiple projects to strengthen my Python skills.
-The projects focus on problem-solving, software design, and creating user-friendly applications.


**Task 1: Simple AI ChatBot**

**Description:**
-A simple Python-based chatbot that responds to user input using pattern matching with regular expressions.
-This chatbot is designed to have fun and interactive conversations while demonstrating the use of Python, regex, and basic AI concepts
**Features:**
-Greets the user and asks for their name
-Responds to keywords such as planet, joke, AI, hello, alien
-Uses randomized responses for more natural interaction
-Allows the user to exit anytime by typing bye, quit, or exit
-Clean and modular code structure with OOP principles
**Tech Stack:**
-Python
-File handling for data storage



**Task 2: Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI**
